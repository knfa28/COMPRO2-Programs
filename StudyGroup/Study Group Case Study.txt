In a study group, members can attend study sessions (keep track of how many sessions they have attended). 
Tutors are members who have specific specialty subjects. They can hold sessions and study a subject, thus adding it to their specialties.

A session focuses on particular topics in a course. It can have multiple members and tutors but the total number of members and tutors cannot exceed an amount set by the tutor.

As for the study group, members can be added; tutors can be added; members can be promoted to tutors. Members can leave the group as well as tutors. All sessions must be kept track of.

Create a class diagram for this problem. =) Implementation is optional.
